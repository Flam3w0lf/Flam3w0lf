My name is James Goetz. I'm originally from Los Angeles, California. I have been working remotely for 5+ years. Although I am currently a self-employed, I am actively looking for a full-time employer!

I have been a Business Development Officer, Account Manager and Consultant for 6+ years & have transacted in over 1000 high value transactions.
If you are interested in my services you can reach me at JGoetz2022@gmail.com. 

From an early age I have had a fiery curiosity for many different things.
My parents gave me an incredible education and empowered me to develop a huge array of my passions. 
In a nutshell... growing up I was the computer nerd who worked hard to become a great athlete.
Team building and being part of a community of diverse people comes naturally to me because I have working towards it my entire life. 

Working in the finance industry has driven me to help businesses use data to develop better strategies for success.
Once upon a time I was the employee processing thousands of pages a day in order to do analysis for a private investment bank. 
Today I see a digital future where data analytics, keen business strategies and algorithms along with driven and authentic relationship building creates perpetual success. 

Outside of work I enjoy gardening, cooking and a plethora of outdoor activities. 
I have been a fire performer for over 14 years where I have learned to spin Maori fire poi and breathe fire.
I also love the mountains and have climbed some of the highest peaks in the United States; some above 14,000 ft.
For as long as I remember I’ve been a community builder… it is one of my greatest passions.
In fact I founded the largest snowboarding community in California (which now raises money year round for non-profits).
Traveling is also a huge passion of mine; I have visited 20 states and 7 different countries (outside the US).
I will always continue traveling so that I give myself the best opportunity to visit new places, experience different cultures and learn about other societies that make up humanity.

Although this is just a taste of who I am… 
You can trust that will be a unique member of your team who excels at learning and adapting with a determination to grow myself and the business.
